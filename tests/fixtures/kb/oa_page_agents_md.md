Codex reads `AGENTS.md` files before doing any work. By layering global guidance with project-specific overrides, you can start each task with consistent expectations, no matter which repository you open.

## How Codex discovers guidance

Codex builds an instruction chain when it starts (once per run; in the TUI this usually means once per launched session). Discovery follows this precedence order:

1. **Global scope:** In your Codex home directory (defaults to `~/.codex`, unless you set `CODEX_HOME`), Codex reads `AGENTS.override.md` if it exists. Otherwise, Codex reads `AGENTS.md`. Codex uses only the first non-empty file at this level.
2. **Project scope:** Starting at the project root (typically the Git root), Codex walks down to your current working directory. If Codex cannot find a project root, it only checks the current directory. In each directory along the path, it checks for `AGENTS.override.md`, then `AGENTS.md`, then any fallback names in `project_doc_fallback_filenames`. Codex includes at most one file per directory.
3. **Merge order:** Codex concatenates files from the root down, joining them with blank lines. Files closer to your current directory override earlier guidance because they appear later in the combined prompt.

Codex skips empty files and stops adding files once the combined size reaches the limit defined by `project_doc_max_bytes` (32 KiB by default). For details on these knobs, see [Project instructions discovery](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-advanced#project-instructions-discovery). Raise the limit or split instructions across nested directories when you hit the cap.

## Create global guidance

Create persistent defaults in your Codex home directory so every repository inherits your working agreements.

1. Ensure the directory exists:

```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.codex
```

2. Create `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` with reusable preferences:

```md
   # ~/.codex/AGENTS.md

   ## Working agreements

   - Always run `npm test` after modifying JavaScript files.
   - Prefer `pnpm` when installing dependencies.
   - Ask for confirmation before adding new production dependencies.
```

3. Run Codex anywhere to confirm it loads the file:

```bash
   codex --ask-for-approval never "Summarize the current instructions."
```
