# Slash commands in Codex CLI

## Examples

### Inspect the session with `/status`

1. In any chat, type `/status`.
2. Review the output for the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and
   current token usage. When the TUI connects remotely, the output also
   shows the remote address and the server version.

Expected: Codex prints a summary confirming that it's operating where you
expect.

### View account usage with `/usage`

1. Type `/usage` to open the usage menu.
2. Choose whether to show token activity or redeem an available earned reset.
3. To open token activity directly, type `/usage daily`, `/usage weekly`, or `/usage cumulative`.

Expected: Codex opens usage actions or shows account token activity for the
selected view. If the session doesn't have Codex service account auth, Codex
shows a sign-in requirement.

### Inspect config layers with `/debug-config`

1. Type `/debug-config`.
2. Review the output for config layer order (lowest precedence first), on/off
   state, and policy sources.

Expected: Codex prints layer diagnostics plus policy details such as
`allowed_approval_policies`, `allowed_sandbox_modes`, `mcp_servers`, `rules`,
and `experimental_network` when configured.

Use this output to debug why an effective setting differs from `config.toml`.

### Configure footer items with `/statusline`

1. Type `/statusline`.
2. Use the picker to toggle and reorder items, then confirm.

Expected: The footer status line updates immediately and persists to
`tui.status_line` in `config.toml`.

Available status-line items include model, model+reasoning, context stats, rate
limits, git branch, token counters, session id, current directory/project root,
and Codex version.
